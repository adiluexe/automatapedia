      - Collatz sequence
      - Euclidean algorithm steps
      - Fibonacci sequence
      - Tribonacci sequence
      - Lucas sequence
      - Pascal's triangle rows
    - **Interactive Visualization:** Display the generated sequences and patterns in a clear and interactive manner.
    - **User Input:** Allow users to define initial parameters for sequence generation (e.g., starting number for Collatz, initial values for Fibonacci).
    - **Information Display:** Provide brief explanations of each sequence, its mathematical background, and its relevance to automata theory.

- **2.2 Design and User Experience:**
  - **Vintage Theme:** Incorporate a vintage aesthetic with a modern twist.

3.  Functional Requirements\* **3.1 Sequence Generation Module:**
    - Each sequence generator should:
      - Take user-defined input parameters (if applicable).
      - Calculate and generate the sequence or pattern.
      - Store the generated data in a suitable data structure.
    - Error handling:
      - Handle invalid input (e.g., non-numeric input, negative numbers where not appropriate).
      - Prevent infinite loops or excessive computation (e.g., for the Collatz sequence, implement a maximum iteration limit).

- **3.2 Visualization Module:**
  - Display the generated sequences in a user-friendly format:
    - Lists for linear sequences (Fibonacci, etc.)
    - Graphical representation for Pascal's triangle.
    - Step-by-step output for the Euclidean algorithm.
  - Implement interactive elements:
    - Hover effects to highlight sequence elements.
    - Tooltips to display additional information.
    - Optional animation of sequence generation.
- **3.3 User Interface (UI) Module:**
  - Consistent design and layout across all sections.
  - Clear and intuitive navigation.
  - Input fields with labels and validation.
  - Informative display of sequence results.
  - The vintage theme is applied to all UI elements.
- **3.4 Information Module**
  - For each sequence, display:
    - A descriptive title.
    - The mathematical formula or recursive definition.
    - Examples of the sequence.
    - Connection to automata theory (if applicable).
    - Links to external resources for further reading.

4.  Non-Functional Requirements\* **4.1 Performance:**
    - The application should load quickly.

  - The interface should be intuitive and self-explanatory.
  - Clear instructions and feedback should be provided to the user.
- **4.3 Reliability:**
  - The application should be stable and error-free.
  - Input validation should prevent unexpected behavior.
- **4.4 Maintainability:**
  - The codebase should be well-organized, modular, and easy to maintain.
  - Use clear and consistent coding conventions.
  - Include comments to explain complex logic.
- **4.5 Accessibility:**
  - The application should be accessible to users with disabilities, following WCAG guidelines.
  - Ensure proper semantic HTML.
  - Provide alternative text for images.
  - Keyboard navigation should be supported.
- **4.6 Technology:**
  - **HTML**
  - **CSS** (with modern techniques like CSS Grid, Flexbox, and Animations)
  - **JavaScript**
  - (Potentially a JavaScript framework, depending on complexity)

5.  Design Considerations\* **5.1 Visual Style:**
    - **Theme:** Vintage with a modern twist.
    - **Colors:** A muted color palette with contrasting accents. Think aged paper, dark wood, and metallic details.
    - **Typography:** Typewriter-style font for headings and body text, with a more modern sans-serif font for supplementary information or UI elements if needed for clarity.
    - **Imagery:** Use subtle textures and patterns reminiscent of vintage paper or mechanical designs.

- **5.2 Layout:**
  - Clear and consistent layout across all pages.
  - Use of white space to create a clean and uncluttered design.
  - Logical grouping of related elements.
- **5.3 Interactions:**
  - Smooth and subtle animations to enhance user experience.
  - Clear visual feedback for user actions (e.g., button clicks, input focus).
  - Consistent use of transitions and effects.
