# Automatapedia

Automatapedia is an interactive web application designed to visualize and generate mathematical sequences related to automata theory. It serves as an educational and engaging tool for students, educators, and enthusiasts interested in mathematical sequences and computational patterns.

## Project Goal

To create an interactive web application that visualizes and generates mathematical sequences related to automata theory, providing an educational and engaging tool for students and enthusiasts.

## Target Audience

- Students studying automata theory, discrete mathematics, or computer science.
- Educators teaching these subjects.
- Individuals interested in mathematical sequences and computational patterns.

## Core Features

- **Sequence Generation:**
  - Collatz sequence
  - Euclidean algorithm steps
  - Fibonacci sequence
  - Tribonacci sequence
  - Lucas sequence
  - Pascal's triangle rows
- **Interactive Visualization:** Display the generated sequences and patterns in a clear and interactive manner.
- **User Input:** Allow users to define initial parameters for sequence generation.
- **Information Display:** Provide brief explanations of each sequence, its mathematical background, and its relevance to automata theory.

## Design and User Experience

- **Vintage Theme:** Incorporates a vintage aesthetic with a modern twist, using a muted color palette with contrasting accents (e.g., aged paper, dark wood, metallic details).
- **Typography:** Utilizes typewriter-style fonts (Chivo Mono) for headings and a modern sans-serif font (Chivo) for body text to evoke a vintage feel while ensuring readability.
- **Animations:** Implements smooth and subtle animations using Framer Motion to enhance user engagement and provide visual feedback.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the application is accessible and functional across various devices (desktops, tablets, and smartphones).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - HTML5
  - CSS3 (Custom CSS with CSS Grid/Flexbox)
  - Vite (Build tool)
- **Routing:** React Router
- **Animations:** Framer Motion
